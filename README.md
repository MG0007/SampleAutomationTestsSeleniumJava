# SampleAutomationTestsSeleniumJava
The repo represents certain level of skills and knowledge in QA test automation

The sole purpose of the repository is to showcase a certain level of knowledge and skills. It is just a sample and not an exhaustive representation of those levels. In some areas, the code might be deficient while in others, it might not be deep enough to demonstrate full potential.

To run the code, Intellij IDEA is required. Download is available [HERE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).

Once Intellij is installed, the repository can be cloned or downloaded. The download approach is simpler, since it does not require any authentication credentials. It is recommended the download target is a folder on the desktop or some other place in the file system. Once the download is completed, it can be unzipped in the same folder.

Start Intellij -> File -> Open -> navigate to the folder where the repository has been unzipped.
Expand src folder and right-click on Helpers folder. Towards the bottom of the submenu, click on "Mark directory as" and select "Root Source".
Expand test -> java -> click/ double click on DemoAutomation.
Right click to the LEFT of the line "public class DemoAutomation" and select "Run DemoAutomation".
